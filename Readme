# Secure Login and Signup System

This project implements a secure login and signup system using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). It ensures user authentication and account creation with robust security measures.

## Features

### Login System
- Users can log in using their username and password.
- Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 and stored with a salt for added security.
- Tracks login attempts and locks the application after three failed attempts.

### Signup System
- Users can create new accounts with a username and password.
- Password strength is evaluated using a progress bar and labeled as "Weak," "Medium," or "Strong."
- Passwords must meet specific criteria:
  - At least 8 characters
  - Uppercase letter
  - Lowercase letter
  - Number
  - Special character
- Passwords are hashed with a randomly generated salt before being stored.

### UI Design
- Gradient background for aesthetic appeal.
- Buttons and input fields styled with hover effects and custom borders.
- Signup form includes a password strength meter and requirements display.

### Security Measures
- Passwords are securely hashed and salted.
- Password arrays are cleared after use to prevent memory leaks.
- Login attempts are logged in a file (`login_audit_log.txt`) with timestamps and statuses.

### Error Handling
- Displays error messages for invalid login attempts, weak passwords, or duplicate usernames.
- Ensures proper handling of file operations for logging.

## Code Structure

### `Login_page` Class
- Handles the login functionality and UI.
- Includes methods for hashing passwords, logging attempts, and validating user credentials.

### `SignupForm` Class
- Handles the signup functionality and UI.
- Includes methods for password strength evaluation, user registration, and salt generation.

### Main Method
- Initializes the application and sets the system look and feel.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a Java compiler.
2. Run the application to display the login page.
3. Use the "Sign Up" button to create a new account.
4. Log in using the newly created credentials.

## Example Usage
- Default credentials:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `Admin@123`

## File Logging
- Login attempts are logged in `login_audit_log.txt` with details like username, timestamp, and status.

## Dependencies
- Java Swing for GUI.
- Java Security for password hashing and salt generation.
